<p>3D MODELLING AND 4D ANIMATION</p>

<ol>
	<li>3D Modelling</li>
	<p>The ACA collective has firmly established his leadership as an emerging association in developping countries, and is therefore in a good position
	  to transfer its knowledge to contextual
	   social applications. Applications such
	    as Photoshop, Illustrator, AfterEffect,
	     Premiere Pro, Cinema 4D, Clo 3D, Lightburn,
	      Indesign are among the many tools that may
	       assist ACA's creational process.</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	
	
	<li>4D Animation</li>
	<p>By combining Infographics to software coding, ACA is now able to guide audio-visual projets towards the highest international standards within 4D environments.</p>
	<p>3D elements are put in motions by basic fundamentals of the principles of animation. Cell-Animation and Key-Frames structural design can be combined to a need-oriented approch of programmation.</p>

    <h3>Targets and Achievements:</h3>
    
	<h4> Targetted object-oriented programmation</h4>
	<p>ACA is also a great local network for the sourcing of talented scholars. Object-oriented programmation is a must-know nowadays and secured machine learning is the key to unlock the full-potential of a great idea.</p>
	
	<h3>Achievements</h3>
	<p>The ACA association gathers experts in the fields of Sciences, Law, Informatics, Music, Arts and Designs, Health, Sports and more. The ACA locals of Yaounde II Soa will help in providing advice and guidance locally around the University Campus.</p>
